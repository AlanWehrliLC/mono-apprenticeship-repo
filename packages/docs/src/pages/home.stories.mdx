# Get started
## Learn Design System

This is my first Design System documentation, where I am using to learn how to build packages and this documentation of React components! And a monorepo!

>> [mono-apprenticeship-repo](https://github.com/AlanWehrliLC/mono-apprenticeship-repo)

Packages

>> [@awlc/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@awlc/react)

>> [@awlc/tokens](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@awlc/tokens)

### Install

Components are written in React.

Add the components to your project.

`npm install @awlc/react`

#### **Use**

Import components you want into your UI

`import { Avatar, Button } from '@awlc/react';`

and use them like so

```
  const example = () => (
    <div>
      <Avatar alt="Alan Wehrli"  src="https://github.com/AlanWehrliLC.png" />
      <Button variant="primary" onClick={() => ()}>Send</Button>
    </div>
  )
```
As a react component!
